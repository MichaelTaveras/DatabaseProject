<P>Our company, the Internet BookShop, Inc., manages and maintains this website in order to sell our reading materials across the country. As a member of this website, you are held to certain policies and rules from the moment you create your account on our system.</P>

<P>The first of those rules is that by creating an account, you declare that the personal information you have provided, including your name, address, e-mail address, and phone number, are accurate. Failure to provide accurate information can result in the termination of your account, and where monetary concerns are involved, possible legal action against you.</P>

<P>Next, when you place an order online, you agree that the credit card number you are using is legal and that you are authorized to use it.  Those under 18 must receive the permission of a parent or guardian before placing an order. We reserve the right to verify your credit card information electronically and to report it to the police if we suspect credit card fraud.</P>

<P>You may cancel or modify orders by e-mailing our staff, but only if the order has not been shipped before the administrator processes your e-mail request. We are not responsible if an order ships before we have had time to process your request. You may return an order that has been shipped to you, less shipping and handling, by shipping the un-opened package back to our company with a note explaining the reason for the return. We will process your package right away and reimburse your credit card as necessary. We do agree to pay for shipping and handling both ways if it is determined that we have sent books that were not on your electronic order receipt.</P>

<P>Finally, we hope to provide a peaceful environment for people of all ages, races, and backgrounds. If you are in some way violating this goal, or causing mischief of any kind on our system, we reserve the right to terminate your account at our discretion. We hope you have a pleasant online experience and we are happy to serve your needs.</P>
